A blog is a platform to share our knowledge, boost SEO of the site and increase the reputation. Creating a blog may not a difficult task these days for anyone, but to host the blog, we need a perfect hosting server which we need to purchase.

This project was developed for people who want to reduce their cost from purchasing high-end servers to maintain their blogs.
